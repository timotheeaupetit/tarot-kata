# Tarot kata

## Introduction
The [French tarot](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_fran%C3%A7ais) is a competitive card game.
The goal is to score the most points.

It's officially played with 4 players, but there are variants with 3 or 5 players.

For each game, one player challenges the others trying to fulfill a contract.
Depending on the total number of trick points and the number of "oudlers" the challenger has, the contract is more or less easy to fulfill.

There can be bonuses, depending on declarations made before a game begins (see rules).

## Kata
The goal is to propose a solution to calculate scores for each player, for a game, for a set of games, taking bonuses into account...
